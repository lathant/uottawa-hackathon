To reduce food wastes that every has by having surplus of ingredients

Gives recipes based on the ingredients that the user has, so that user does not have to make extra trips to stores

# How we built it
We set up milestones, and met targets to ensure that our project was feasible at all times

# Challenges we ran into
Time constraints were always a pressure in development, since we had to drop ideas for the sake of feasibility

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the how much we got done, and proud to contribute toward solving a growing problem in the average household

# What we learned
A strong collaborative team allows us to be more than the sum of our parts
